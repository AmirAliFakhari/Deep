* Discuss the role of knowledge, where it comes from
* Introduce philosophical views of knowledge
* Introduce the notion of a "model"
* Introduce maximum likelihood, the statistical objective
* Talk about the limited nature of observations -> Empirical Risk Minimization, Law of Large Numbers
* Talk about Dataâ€‘generating processes -> The statistical jargon basically.
* Bias-variance tradeoff. How bias is a reflection of how closely a model matches the true data-generating process/function and how variance is related to where the drawn sample exactly falls. 
* Hypothesis space, constraining it, regularization, overfitting.
