# Two views of intelligence
* **Symbolism** says knowledge is constructed in terms of facts and rules about abstract symbols. Basically IF-THEN rules, or chess programs that search trees of possibilities, or using grammatical rules to parse language.

    *1950s - 1980s*
* **Associationism** does not see inherent internal structure or logic within the mind. Instead, each thought is just a sequence of associations, and associations between simple ideas/sensory experiences is formed by three main mechanisms:
    *   **Contiguity:** Things that occur together in time or space become linked (e.g., lightning and thunder).
    *   **Similarity:** Things that share features become linked (e.g., thinking of an apple might make you think of a pear).
    *   **Repetition:** The more often two things are paired, the stronger their association.

    This view sort of laid the foundation for modern ANNs and **Connectionism**. It is also the driving force behind the Hebbian theory of learning: "what fires together, wires together".
    
    *17th-19th Century*
* **Connectionism** is an emergent property from the collective activity of a large network of simple, interconnected processing units (neurons). The knowledge is purely abstract and stored within the connections, and such agents are "black boxes", meaning that their thought process is not transparent. The idea behind learning the "weights" of the connections within connectionism is similar to the idea of Associationism, despite the difference in the approacha/algorithm.
    *1990s - Present*
